## Tools Overview
- Electron (front-end and back-end)
- React (front-end)
- SQLite3

### Electron
A framework that enables developers to create desktop applications using web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It combines:
- Chromium for rendering web content.
- Node.js for backend integration.
- Applications built with Electron include Slack, Visual Studio Code, and Discord.

**Advantages:** 
- Allows you to package an app for multiple OS (Windows, macOS, Linux) from a single code base.
- Large developer community and plugin support.

**Challenges:**
- Higher memory usage compared to native apps.
- Potential for larger app sizes.

-------

### React 
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It uses:
- Components: Reusable building blocks.
- Virtual DOM: Optimizes rendering performance.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to maintain with modular code.
- High performance due to virtual DOM.

**Use Cases:**
- Single-page applications (SPAs).
- Dynamic websites and dashboards.

---- 

### SQLite3
SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained database engine often embedded in applications. It's widely used in:
- Mobile apps (e.g., Android, iOS).
- Lightweight desktop applications.

**Advantages:**
- Requires minimal configuration.
- Fast and resource-efficient.

**Considerations:**
- Limited support for concurrent multi-user access.
